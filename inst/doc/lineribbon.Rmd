## Introduction
  
The following vignette describes the `geom_lineribbon()` family of stats and geoms in `ggdist`, a family of stats and geoms
for creating line+ribbon plots: for example, plots with a fit line and one or more uncertainty bands. This vignette also
describes the `curve_interval()` function for calculating curvewise (joint) intervals for lineribbon plots.


## Setup
  
The following libraries are required to run this vignette:
  
```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggdist)
library(ggplot2)
library(distributional)
library(cowplot)

theme_set(theme_ggdist())
```

```{r hidden_options, include=FALSE}
.old_options = options(width = 120)
```


## The lineribbon family

The lineribbon family follows the same naming scheme as the larger family of slabinterval geoms (see `vignette("slabinterval")`).
It has three members: `geom_lineribbon()`, `stat_lineribbon()`, and `stat_dist_lineribbon()`.

* `geom_lineribbon()` is meant to be used on data already summarized into points and intervals.
* `stat_lineribbon()` is meant to be used on sample data; e.g. draws from a posterior distribution of lines/curves, a bootstrap sampling distribution of lines/curves, an ensemble distribution, or any other distribution, really. This stat computes relevant summaries (points and intervals) before forwarding the summaries to `geom_lineribbon()`.
* `stat_dist_lineribbon()` can be used to create lineribbon geoms for analytical distributions. It takes either [distributional](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/distributional/) objects or distribution names (the `dist` aesthetic) and arguments (the `args` aesthetic or `arg1`, ... `arg9` aesthetics) and compute the relevant slabs and intervals.

All lineribbon geoms can be plotted horizontally or vertically. Depending on how aesthetics are mapped, they will attempt to automatically determine the orientation; if this does not produce the correct result, the orientation can be overridden by setting `orientation = "horizontal"` or `orientation = "vertical"`.


## Lineribbons on already-summarized data

The base lineribbon geometry can only be applied to already-summarized data: data frames where
each row contains a point and the upper and lower bounds of an interval. For the purposes of
this example, we will first look at how to generate such a data frame from a data frame
of sample data; such data could include Bayesian posterior 
distributions (for examples of this usage, see vignettes in [tidybayes](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/)) or
bootstrap sampling distributions. For the simple example here, we'll just generate a distribution of lines
manually:

```{r df}
n = 5000

df = tibble(
  .draw = 1:n,
  intercept = rnorm(n, 3, 1),
  slope = rnorm(n, 1, 0.25),
  x = list(-4:5),
  y = map2(intercept, slope, ~ .x + .y * -4:5)
) %>%
  unnest(c(x, y))
```

`df` is a 50,000-row data frame with a sample of 5000 y values for each x value. It represents a sample
of 5000 lines. Here is a subsample of 100 of the lines:

```{r spaghetti, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
df %>%
  filter(.draw %in% 1:100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, group = .draw)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.25)
```

We can summarize the data frame at each x position using `median_qi()` (or any other function in the `point_interval()` family):

```{r summarized_df}
df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  median_qi(y)
```

Given data summarized like that above, we can then construct a line+ribbon chart using `geom_lineribbon()`:

```{r one_ribbon}
df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  median_qi(y) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  geom_lineribbon()
```

`geom_lineribbon()` automatically pulls in the `.width` column and maps it onto the
`fill` aesthetic so that intervals of different widths get different colors. However,
the result with just one interval is not great, as the default color scheme is
quite dark with just one color. Let's make two changes to improve the chart:

1. We will use the `.width` argument of `median_qi()` to generate multiple uncertainty bands
(a 50%, 80%, and 95% band).
2. We will use `scale_fill_brewer()` to get a nicer color scheme.

The result looks like this:

```{r geom_lineribbon, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  median_qi(y, .width = c(.50, .80, .95)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  geom_lineribbon() +
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

## Lineribbons on sample data

To apply lineribbons to sample data, we can also use `stat_lineribbon()` instead of summarizing the data
first using `median_qi()` or `point_interval()`. This function does the summarization internally for you.

Taking the previous example, we can simply removing the lines that summarize the data first, and omit
the aesthetic mappings onto `ymin` and `ymax`, which are automatically set by `stat_lineribbon()`. This
simplifies the previous example considerably:

```{r stat_lineribbon, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  stat_lineribbon() +
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

The default `.width` setting of `stat_lineribbon()` is `c(.50, .80, .95)`, as can be seen in the results above. We can
change this as well; for example:

```{r stat_lineribbon_width, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  stat_lineribbon(.width = c(.66, .95)) +
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

## Lineribbons on analytical distributions

Lineribbons can also be applied to analytical distributions. This use case often arises with confidence distributions
describing uncertainty in a fit line; for an example, see the end of `vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis")`. Here,
we will look at a simpler example where we construct the distributions manually; here we'll assume some
variable `y` that is normally distributed conditional on `x` with mean `y_mean` and standard deviation `y_sd`:

```{r analytical_df}
analytical_df = tibble(
  x = -4:5,
  y_mean = 3 + x,
  y_sd = sqrt(x^2/10 + 1),
)
analytical_df
```

We can visualize this conditional distribution with `stat_dist_lineribbon()` using `distributional::dist_normal()`:

```{r stat_dist_lineribbon}
analytical_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, dist = dist_normal(y_mean, y_sd))) +
  stat_dist_lineribbon() +
  scale_fill_brewer()
```


## Curve boxplots (aka lineribbons with joint intervals or curvewise intervals)

The above examples all calculate *conditional* intervals, either using `point_interval()` (directly or indirectly) or
using quantiles of an analytical distribution. However, you may not always want conditional intervals.

Where `point_interval()` calculates *pointwise* intervals, or intervals *conditional* on each group, `curve_interval()` calculates *joint* or *curvewise* intervals. In the literature these are also called *curve boxplots* ([Mirzargar *et al.* 2014](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346455), [Juul *et al.* 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05035)).

An example will help illustrate the difference between the two types of intervals. Consider the following set of curves, where each curve is assumed to be a "draw" from some distribution of curves, $\mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are vectors:

```{r curve_draws, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
k = 11 # number of curves
n = 501
df = tibble(
    .draw = 1:k,
    mean = seq(-5,5, length.out = k),
    x = list(seq(-15,15,length.out = n)),
  ) %>%
  unnest(x) %>%
  mutate(y = dnorm(x, mean, 3)/max(dnorm(x, mean, 3)))

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = .draw), alpha=0.2)
```

If one used one of the `point_interval()` functions to summarize this curve (such as `median_qi()`, `mean_qi()`, etc), it would calculate *pointwise* intervals:

```{r pointwise_ribbon, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  median_qi(y, .width = c(.5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_lineribbon(aes(ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = .draw), alpha=0.15, data = df) +
  scale_fill_brewer() +
  ggtitle("50% pointwise intervals with point_interval()")
```

The 50% *pointwise* interval calculated at (say) $x = 1$ would contain 50% of the draws from $y|x=1$. At a different value of $x$, say $x = 2$, the 50% pointwise interval would also contain 50% of the draws from $y|x = 2$. However, the specific draws contained in the interval for $y|x=2$ might be *different* draws from those contained in the interval for $x|y=1$: if you trace any of the underlying curves, you will notice that each curve is included in some intervals and not included in others. Thus, the set of intervals---the ribbon---may not fully contain 50% of curves. Indeed, inspecting the above plot, the 50% ribbon contains **none** of the curves!

Depending on what type of inference we care about, this might be sufficient for our purposes: maybe we are interested just in what the outcome is likely to be at a given x value (a conditional inference), but we are not interested in joint inferences (e.g., what is the shape of the curve likely to look like?). However, if we *are* interested in such joint inferences, pointwise intervals can be misleading. The shape of the median curve, for example, looks nothing like any of the possible outcomes. The interval also does not include the maximum value of *any* of the underlying curves, which might cause us to conclude (incorrectly) that a value close to 1 is unlikely, when the exact opposite is the case (every curve touches 1).

One solution I like for such situations is to show spaghetti plots: just plot the underlying curves. This is a so-called *frequency framing* uncertainty visualization, and it tends to work fairly well. However, in some cases you may want a visual summary using intervals, in which case curvewise intervals could help. Using `curve_interval()` instead of `point_interval()` or `median_qi()` calculates these:

```{r curvewise_ribbon, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_height}
df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  curve_interval(y, .width = c(.5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_lineribbon(aes(ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = .draw), alpha=0.15, data = df) +
  scale_fill_brewer() +
  ggtitle("50% curvewise intervals with curve_interval()")
```

Note how the 50% *curvewise* interval now contains half of the underlying curves, and the median curve *is* one of the underlying curves (so it is more representative of the curve shape we should expect). These intervals also cover the peaks of the curves, where the pointwise intervals did not.

An X% *curvewise* interval is calculated across all the curves by taking the top X% closest curves to the central curve, for some definition of "close" and "central". The `curve_interval()` function currently orders curves by mean halfspace depth, which is basically how close each curve is to the pointwise median in percentiles, on average.

Given the above, let's see what more realistic curvewise intervals of the above example might look like by using a larger number of draws:

```{r pointwise_curvewise, fig.width = med_width, fig.height = med_width}
k = 1000 # number of curves
large_df = tibble(
    .draw = 1:k,
    mean = seq(-5,5, length.out = k),
    x = list(seq(-15,15,length.out = n)),
  ) %>%
  unnest(x) %>%
  mutate(y = dnorm(x, mean, 3)/max(dnorm(x, mean, 3)))

pointwise_plot = large_df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  median_qi(y, .width = c(.5, .8, .95)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, color = "gray75", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_lineribbon(aes(ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  scale_fill_brewer() +
  ggtitle("point_interval()")

curvewise_plot = large_df %>%
  group_by(x) %>%
  curve_interval(y, .width = c(.5, .8, .95)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, color = "gray75", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_lineribbon(aes(ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  scale_fill_brewer() +
  ggtitle("curve_interval()")

plot_grid(nrow = 2,
  pointwise_plot, curvewise_plot
)
```

Notice how the pointwise intervals miss out on the peaks of this distribution of curves. Even the 95% ribbon, which appears to reach up to the peaks, in fact falls slightly short. While this is a bit of a pathological example, it does demonstrate the potential shortcomings of pointwise intervals.
