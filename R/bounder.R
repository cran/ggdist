#' Estimate bounds of a distribution using the CDF of its order statistics
#'
#' Estimate the bounds of the distribution a sample came from using the CDF of
#' the order statistics of the sample. Use with the `bounder` argument to [density_bounded()].
#' Supports [automatic partial function application][automatic-partial-functions].
#'
#' @param x numeric vector containing a sample to estimate the bounds of.
#' @param p scalar in \eqn{[0,1]}: percentile of the order statistic distribution to use
#'   as the estimate. `p = 1` will return `range(x)`; `p = 0.5` will give the median
#'   estimate, `p = 0` will give a very wide estimate (effectively treating the
#'   distribution as unbounded when used with [density_bounded()]).
#'
#' @details
#' [bounder_cdf()] uses the distribution of the order statistics of
#' \eqn{X} to estimate where the first and last order statistics (i.e. the
#' min and max) of this distribution would be, assuming the sample `x` is the
#' distribution. Then, it adjusts the boundary outwards from `min(x)` (or `max(x)`)
#' by the distance between `min(x)` (or `max(x)`) and the nearest estimated
#' order statistic.
#'
#' Taking \eqn{X} = `x`, the distributions of the first and last order statistics are:
#'
#' \deqn{\begin{array}{rcl}
#' F_{X_{(1)}}(x) &=& 1 - \left[1 - F_X(x)\right]^n\\
#' F_{X_{(n)}}(x) &=& F_X(x)^n
#' \end{array}}
#'
#' Re-arranging, we can get the inverse CDFs (quantile functions) of each
#' order statistic in terms of the quantile function of \eqn{X} (which we
#' can estimate from the data), giving us an estimate for the minimum
#' and maximum order statistic:
#'
#' \deqn{\begin{array}{rcrcl}
#' \hat{x_1} &=& F_{X_{(1)}}^{-1}(p) &=& F_X^{-1}\left[1 - (1 - p)^{1/n}\right]\\
#' \hat{x_n} &=& F_{X_{(n)}}^{-1}(p) &=& F_X^{-1}\left[p^{1/n}\right]
#' \end{array}}
#'
#' Then the estimated bounds are:
#'
#' \deqn{\left[2\min(x) - \hat{x_1}, 2\max(x) - \hat{x_n} \right]}
#'
#' These bounds depend on \eqn{p}, the percentile of the distribution of the order
#' statistic used to form the estimate. While \eqn{p = 0.5} (the median) might be
#' a reasonable choice (and gives results similar to [bounder_cooke()]), this tends
#' to be a bit too aggressive in "detecting" bounded distributions, especially in
#' small sample sizes. Thus, we use a default of \eqn{p = 0.01}, which tends to
#' be very conservative in small samples (in that it usually gives results
#' roughly equivalent to an unbounded distribution), but which still performs
#' well on bounded distributions when sample sizes are larger (in the thousands).

  # distribution of its first and last order statistics are:
  #  F_X_1(x) = 1 - (1 - F_X(x))^n
  #  F_X_n(x) = F_X(x)^n

  # in terms of the quantile function of X:
  #  F_X_1^-1(p) = F_X^-1(1 - (1 - p)^(1/n))
  #  F_X_n^-1(p) = F_X^-1(p^(1/n))
  # e.g. by default (when p = 0.5) we can use the median of these distributions
  # as our estimates by
  #  X_1_hat = F_X^-1(1 - p^(1/n)) = F_X^-1(1 - p_sample)
  #  X_n_hat = F_X^-1(p^(1/n)) = F_X^-1(p_sample)
  # Where p_sample = p^(1/n)
  # Then the estimated bounds are:
  #  2 * min(x) - X_1_hat
  #  2 * max(x) - X_n_hat
  p_sample = p^(1/length(x))

  # can save a lot of computation on very large samples by not computing
  # anything beyond that point (= n_nonzero). The reciprocal of the square root
  # of this point becomes roughly linear in 1/n at large n. The coefficients

  # Method from Cooke (1979) Statistical Inference for Bounds of Random Variables,
  # re-written so i is 1 to n (instead of 0 to n - 1) and we multiply by X_(i)
  # instead of X_(n - i) (to avoid having to reverse x):
  #   i = seq_along(x)
  #   c(

  # Then, we re-write that to use logs (to make computation faster and more
  # stable), to only compute the non-zero coefficients, to use dot products
  # instead of sum(coef[i] * x[i]), and to take advantage of the fact that
  # the coefs for x[n] are just the reverse of the coefs for x[1] (so we
