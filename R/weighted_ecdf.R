#' Weighted empirical cumulative distribution function
#'
#' A variation of [ecdf()] that can be applied to weighted samples.
#'
#' @param x numeric vector: sample values
#' @param weights Weights for the sample. One of:
#'  - numeric vector of same length as `x`: weights for corresponding values in `x`,
#'    which will be normalized to sum to 1.
#'  - `NULL`: indicates no weights are provided, so the unweighted empirical
#'    cumulative distribution function (equivalent to [ecdf()]) is returned.
#' @param na.rm logical: if `TRUE`, corresponding entries in `x` and `weights`
#' are removed if either is `NA`.
#'
#' @details
#' Generates a weighted empirical cumulative distribution function, \eqn{F(x)}.
#' Given \eqn{x}, a sorted vector (derived from `x`), and \eqn{w_i}, the corresponding
#' `weight` for \eqn{x_i}, \eqn{F(x)} is a step function with steps at each \eqn{x_i}
#' with \eqn{F(x_i)} equal to the sum of all weights up to and including \eqn{w_i}.
#'
#' @returns
#' `weighted_ecdf()` returns a function of class `"weighted_ecdf"`, which also
#' inherits from the [stepfun()] class. Thus, it also has `plot()` and `print()`
#' methods. Like [ecdf()], [weighted_ecdf()] also provides a [quantile()] method,
#' which dispatches to [weighted_quantile()].
#'

#' @examples
#' weighted_ecdf(1:3, weights = 1:3)
#' plot(weighted_ecdf(1:3, weights = 1:3))
#' quantile(weighted_ecdf(1:3, weights = 1:3), 0.4)
