\title{Automatic partial function application in ggdist}
\description{
Several \pkg{ggdist} functions support \emph{automatic partial application}: when called,
if all of their required arguments have not been provided, the function returns a
modified version of itself that uses the arguments passed to it so far as defaults.
Technically speaking, these functions are essentially "Curried" with respect to
their required arguments, but I think "automatic partial application" gets
the idea across more clearly.

Functions supporting automatic partial application include:
\itemize{
\item The \code{\link[=point_interval]{point_interval()}} family, such as \code{\link[=median_qi]{median_qi()}}, \code{\link[=mean_qi]{mean_qi()}},
\code{\link[=mode_hdi]{mode_hdi()}}, etc.
\item The \code{smooth_} family, such as \code{\link[=smooth_bounded]{smooth_bounded()}}, \code{\link[=smooth_unbounded]{smooth_unbounded()}},
\code{\link[=smooth_discrete]{smooth_discrete()}}, and \code{\link[=smooth_bar]{smooth_bar()}}.
\item The \code{density_} family, such as \code{\link[=density_auto]{density_auto()}}, \code{\link[=density_bounded]{density_bounded()}} and
\code{\link[=density_unbounded]{density_unbounded()}}.
}

Partial application makes it easier to supply custom parameters to these
functions when using them inside other functions, such as geoms and stats.
For example, smoothers for \code{\link[=geom_dots]{geom_dots()}} can be supplied in one of three
ways:
\itemize{
\item as a suffix: \code{geom_dots(smooth = "bounded")}
\item as a function: \code{geom_dots(smooth = smooth_bounded)}
\item as a partially-applied function with options:
\code{geom_dots(smooth = smooth_bounded(kernel = "cosine"))}
}

The \code{density} argument to \code{\link[=stat_slabinterval]{stat_slabinterval()}} works similarly with the
\code{density_} family of functions.

\examples{
set.seed(1234)
x = rnorm(100)

# the first required argument, `x`, of the density_ family is the vector
# to calculate a kernel density estimate from. If it is not provided, the
# function is partially applied and returned as-is
density_auto()

# we could create a new function that uses half the default bandwidth
density_half_bw = density_auto(adjust = 0.5)
density_half_bw

# we can overwrite partially-applied arguments
density_quarter_bw_trimmed = density_half_bw(adjust = 0.25, trim = TRUE)
density_quarter_bw_trimmed

# when we eventually call the function and provide the required argument
# `x`, it is applied using the arguments we have "saved up" so far
density_quarter_bw_trimmed(x)

}
